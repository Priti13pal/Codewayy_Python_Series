# Codewayy_Python_Series

# Task_1 :

This is the First Task of Python_Series !!! This repo is created for beginners as here we can find the small code of python such as working with integer and float variables.we can find the string program which is done by string concatenation. The codes aresimple so that it became easy to understand for those who are studying python first time

# Task_2 :

Earlier, we have seen primitive data type like integers, floats, booleans and strings.But here we are taking a deeper look at the non primitive Python data structure. Data Structure in python (List ,Set, Tuple, Dictionaries) this is the main focus of the task_2 here you will get the information and code of all four data structure i.e (list,set,tuple and dictionary) by using the seven methods, also the concept of slicing and indexing of string in python etc.

# Task 3 :

Task 3 is about 1.if-elif 2.for-while 3.Break statement 4.continous Statement 5.Function

# Task 4 :

Task_4 is about the - 1.Nested Loop 2.Methods in String 3.Logical Operator 4.Import Module We can find the the code to calculate the square of a number ,Prime number printing in a given matrix and Program of logical operator and string related program (small code) etc.

# Task_5 :

Task_5 is about -

1.Exception handling
2.Sorting 
3.Math Module 
4.Reading and writing of files in Python.

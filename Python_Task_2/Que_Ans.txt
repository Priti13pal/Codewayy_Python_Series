              Question and Answer!!! 

Q .1) Why is list used ?
Ans : List is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. 
      List are used when you want to work with many related values.They enable you to keep data together that belongs together that belongs together,
      condense your code, and perform the same method and operation on multiple value at once.



Q .2) How do lists and sets differ ?
Ans : List and sets differ in some aspect -
      List can contain objects of different types, it is ordered(sequence) and duplicate elements can be present it is faster than set
      
      Set can contaion objects of different types ,it is unordered(random sequence) and no duplication is present.Depending on your purpose,mathematical set operation can
      be used ready out of the box such as intersection,difference,union,etc.



Q 3)  Application of dictionaries with a real world example ?
Ans : You can use a dictionary as a jump table to emulate a switch type statement,and to easily count the content of a list.
      literally maps : Say you are building a map of objects on a game field - so each object has an (x,y) co-ordinate.
      Instead of a big list which is mostly empty showing each of the objects - you have a dictionary with the key being a tuple of the (x,y) co-ordinate, and the value being the object at that location.
